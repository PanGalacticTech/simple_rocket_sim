 The Rocket Equation
 
 Variables:
     dV = deltaV max change of velocity of the vehicle
     Mw = Mass (wet) of vehicle & Propellant
     Md = Mass (dry) of vehicle (no Propellant)
     Ve = effective exhaust velocity = Isp(g)
     Isp = Specific Impulse in dimension of time
     g = standard gravity
     ln = standard logarithm function
   
  Equation:   
     dV = Ve * ln(Mw/Md) = Isp * g * ln(Mw/Md)
     
     
    Input Constants
     g = 9.80665 ms^(-2)
     
    Input Variables
    Ve =  g * x m/s
    Isp =  x s (by weight)  or x  N s/kg  (by mass)
    
    Mw = 100 kg
    Md = 20 kg

Thrust

Variables:
    
    Mfr = mass flow rate of expended propellant 
    
Equation:    
    Fthrust = g * Isp * Mfr
    
Input Variables:

    Mfr = 10 kg/s

Isp

Variables:

    Isp = specific impulse in seconds
    Ve = average exhast speed along the axis of the engine 

Equation:    
   Isp = Ve / g          (vac)

Input Variables:

    Isp = X s
    Ve = x m/s
